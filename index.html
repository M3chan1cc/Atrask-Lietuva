                    <h3>Rambynas hill</h3>
                    <p>The sacred hill is surrounded by many legends and stories. According to one of them, the altar stone was put on Rambynas by thunder god Perkūnas who also buried a treasure of gold and silver harrow under the stone. Perkūnas then chose the hill and his home. Another story has it that the altar stone was brought by giant Rambynas, one of three sons of Nemunas, who offered it as a sacrifice to Perkūnas. The hill became a temple attended by priests (krivis) and priestess (vaidilutė). They were driven away by the Teutonic Order, but laumės cursed the stone – while the stone stood, good fortune would bless the region; if the stone was damaged, bad fortunes would follow.</p>

                    <p>This pathway winds through a raised bog that looks like a setting for pagan fairy tales, with its beautiful flowers and rare songbirds. The 2.4 kilometre-long trail is equipped with display boards telling the story of the bog and the people who tried to tame it.</p>

                    <h3>Devils Pit</h3>
                    <p>Once there was a man who wanted to marry a girl he liked. Unfortunately, he was married already, so he could not marry her in the church. He ignored the prohibition, threatened the priest with a sword, and made him solemnize their marriage. As soon as the groom started saying his wedding vows, the church suddenly collapsed into the ground, taking the couple with it. The ringing of the church bell could be heard for the next three days. Devils have their midnight feast here. People say that they could hear the devils screaming and raving. Those who pass by at night can see devils, so no one dares to go close to the Pit in the dark. That is the reason why this horrifying place was named the damned Devil’s Pit.</p>

                    <h3>The Hill of Angels</h3>
                    <p>This is a place for fostering human devotion and spirituality. It is spotted with plenty of finely crafted wooden angel sculptures, wrought sun-like crosses, and life trees decorated with traditional national symbols. In 2009, the Hill of Angels was created to honor Lithuania’s 1000th anniversary and the 600th anniversary of the Basilica of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Trakai. As a result, 18 angel sculptures found a new home on the Hill! The Hill of Angels is today also referred to as the Path of the Millennium Signs.</p>
